============

A fizz buzz calculator implemented in ruby with sinatra: 

This web app automatically performs the fizz buzz (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) calculation on any integer between 0 and 10,000, replacing numbers divisible by 3 with 'fizz', numbers divisible by 5 with 'buzz', and nummbers divisible by both 3 & 5 with 'fizz buzz'.

The 10,000 upper limit can be changed in lib/fizz_buzz.rb
